## Local Development Setup ( Frontend )

Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (**18.15.0**) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are installed.

Check node version using `node --version`

Then in the project directory, run

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Environment Variables

- See **.env.example** for a list of all variable names
- Use **.env** file for production environment
- Use **.env.local** file for use in development

## Scripts

### Run development server

First, run the backend server (see [cmandr-backend](https://github.com/djpri/cmandr-backend)) and make sure that VITE_BASE_URL in .env.local is set to the applicationUrl value in launchSettings.json.

Then run:

```sh
$ npm run start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ to view the app if the page doesn't load automatically.

### Create build folder for production

```sh
$ npm run build
```

### Preview build

```sh
$ npm run serve
```

### Run tests using Vitest

```sh
$ npm run test
```

## Deployment

This application relies on client-side routing, so we redirect all requests to the index.html to be handled by react router.

**vercel.json**

```
{
  "rewrites":  [
    {"source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/"}
  ]
}
```
